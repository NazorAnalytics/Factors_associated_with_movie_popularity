# Investigating the TMDB_Movies dataset

This is one of the projects I carried out while on my Alx sponsored Udacity Nano degree program.
The TMDB-Movie dataset used contains information concerning over 10,000 movies released between 1960 and 2015.
Information contained includes the movie titles, casts, runtime, genres, popularity, the budgets made for each movie,
the revenue earned from each, release year, etc.<br>

The basic research objective here is to determine the factors asssociated with movie popularity.
Research questions investigated include:
<ol>
<li>Are particular genres of movies more popular than others?</li>
<li>Is there a relationship between the popularity of a movie and the amount budgeted for it?</li>
<li>Does the runtime of movies have a relationship with their popularity?</li>
</ol>

Steps were taken to clean the dataset after assessment. The cleaning process has been documented in markdown cells in the Jupyter notebook. <br>

At the end of the investigation of the TMDB-Movies dataset using the popularity of movies as the dependent variable 
and genre, budget and runtime as the independent variables, the following findings were made:
<ol>
<li>Some genres of movies are more popular than others. This was found to be the case
in various time periods and across all the years covered by this investigation .</li>

<li>There is a positive relationship between the popularity of a movie and the amount budgeted for it.
Both variables increased alongside each other in the years covered by this investigation.</li>

<li>The runtime of movies has a fairly positive relationship with their popularity. 
Movies with higher runtime were shown to be more popular than movies with lower runtime.</li>
